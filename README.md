### Core Concepts

#### **Route**
The complete journey from the first waypoint to the last, including all paths and waypoints in between.

#### **Path**
The interpolated curve connecting waypoints. Generated using Catmull-Rom spline interpolation.

#### **Path Points**
The array of calculated coordinate points that define the path. Typically hundreds of points for smooth curves.

#### **Canvas**
The HTML5 canvas element where all rendering occurs. Has two coordinate systems: canvas coordinates and image coordinates.

#### **Background Image**
The map or terrain image displayed behind the route. Can be in "fit" or "fill" mode.

---

### Waypoints & Markers

#### **Waypoint**
A user-defined point along the route. Comes in two types: major and minor.

##### **Major Waypoint**
- Larger visual marker (8px radius)
- Can have pause time (timed pause)
- Can be labeled
- Red circle with white outline by default

##### **Minor Waypoint**
- Smaller visual marker (4px radius)
- No pause functionality
- Used for path control points
- Red circle with white outline by default

#### **Marker**
Visual representation of a waypoint on the canvas. Synonymous with waypoint in visual context.

#### **Marker Style**
Visual appearance of waypoints:
- **Dots** (default): Solid circles
- **Rings**: Hollow circles
- **Crosses**: X-shaped markers
- **Plus**: +-shaped markers

#### **Selected Waypoint**
The waypoint currently selected for editing. Highlighted with yellow glow.

#### **Waypoint Properties**
- `imgX`, `imgY`: Position in image coordinate space
- `isMajor`: Boolean, major vs minor waypoint
- `label`: Text label for major waypoints
- `pauseTime`: Duration in milliseconds
- `pauseMode`: 'none', 'timed', or 'manual'
- `color`, `size`: Visual style properties

---

### Path & Curves

#### **Catmull-Rom Spline**
The interpolation algorithm used to create smooth curves between waypoints. Creates curves that pass through all control points.

#### **Tension**
Parameter controlling curve tightness (0.0 - 1.0):
- **0.0**: Straight lines (no curves)
- **0.2**: Very tight curves (current default)
- **0.5**: Moderate curves
- **1.0**: Maximum smoothness

**Code constant:** `PATH.DEFAULT_TENSION`

#### **Path Shape**
Different path rendering styles:
- **Straight**: Direct Catmull-Rom interpolation
- **Squiggle**: Sine wave modulation for decorative effect
- **Randomised**: Jittered path for hand-drawn appearance

#### **Curvature**
The mathematical measure of how sharply the path bends at any point. Used for corner slowing.

#### **Corner Slowing**
Animation feature that reduces speed at sharp turns for more natural motion.
- **MIN_CORNER_SPEED**: Minimum speed percentage at tightest corners (currently 0.2 = 20%)

#### **Path Length**
Total distance along the path in pixels. Used to calculate animation duration.

#### **Reparameterization**
Process of redistributing path points for even spacing. Ensures consistent animation speed.

---

### Animation & Timing

#### **Animation State**
The complete state of the animation system. Managed by `AnimationEngine`.

#### **Progress**
How far through the animation (0.0 to 1.0):
- `0.0` = Start (0%)
- `0.5` = Halfway (50%)
- `1.0` = End (100%)

**Code:** `animationEngine.state.progress`

#### **Current Time**
Elapsed time in the animation in milliseconds.

**Code:** `animationEngine.state.currentTime`

#### **Duration**
Total animation length in milliseconds. Calculated from path length and speed.

**Code:** `animationEngine.state.duration`

#### **Speed**
Animation velocity in pixels per second (px/s).
- **Default:** 400 px/s
- **Range:** 25 - 1000 px/s

**Code:** `animationEngine.state.speed`

#### **Playback Speed**
Multiplier for animation speed (0.1 - 10.0):
- `0.5` = Half speed
- `1.0` = Normal speed (default)
- `2.0` = Double speed

**Code:** `animationEngine.state.playbackSpeed`
**UI:** Controlled by J/K/L keys

#### **Animation Mode**
Method for calculating animation duration:
- **constant-speed**: Duration based on path length ÷ speed (current default)
- **constant-time**: Fixed duration regardless of path length

#### **Playback Position**
Where the animation currently is (synonym for "current time" in UI context).

#### **Timeline**
The scrubber/slider showing animation progress. Ranges from 0 to 1000 (TIMELINE_RESOLUTION).

#### **Playhead**
The moving indicator showing current position on the path. Also called "path head" or "animation marker".

#### **Waypoint Pause/Wait**
Feature where animation pauses at major waypoints:
- **Timed Pause**: Pauses for specified duration
- **Manual Pause**: Waits for user to resume
- **None**: No pause (default)

---

### Technical Constants Reference

Quick reference for important constants:

```javascript
// Animation
ANIMATION.DEFAULT_SPEED = 400              // px/s
ANIMATION.DEFAULT_DURATION = 10000         // ms
ANIMATION.TARGET_FPS = 60
ANIMATION.TIMELINE_RESOLUTION = 1000       // slider steps

// Path
PATH.DEFAULT_TENSION = 0.2                 // curve tightness
PATH.MIN_CORNER_SPEED = 0.2                // 20% at corners
PATH.POINTS_PER_SEGMENT = 100
PATH.TARGET_SPACING = 2                    // px between points

// Rendering
RENDERING.DEFAULT_DOT_SIZE = 8             // major waypoints
RENDERING.MINOR_DOT_SIZE = 4               // minor waypoints
RENDERING.PATH_HEAD_SIZE = 8
RENDERING.BEACON_PULSE_DURATION = 2000     // ms

### Usage Tips

1. **When reporting bugs:** Include the specific component/service name and exact behavior
2. **When requesting features:** Reference the glossary terms for precision
3. **When discussing values:** Use the actual constant names or numeric values with units
4. **When describing UI:** Use the official element names from this glossary

---

**Example of Good Communication:**

> "The `AnimationEngine` doesn't preserve the `speed` value on reset. When I press the Skip to Start button (⏮), the `animationEngine.state.speed` resets to `ANIMATION.DEFAULT_SPEED` instead of keeping my saved value of 100 px/s. The speed slider UI shows 100, but the animation duration recalculates using 50 px/s."

This precise description makes it immediately clear what the issue is and where to look!
